# Draft (will be deleted)

Initial use cases: I will create some goals that I personally want to do first
and then use them as guide to create the prototype of the book.
- [ ] Build the framework
- [ ] Implement a basic "hello world" contribution to the framework: Try to create
a custom simple widget that shows a hello world Text.
